# Konnektr Infra Repository

This repository manages all cloud infrastructure and Kubernetes platform manifests for the Konnektr startup.

## Structure

- `terraform/` — Infrastructure as code for Google Cloud (GKE, networking, etc.)
- `kubernetes/` — Manifests for platform, ArgoCD, and applications (GitOps)

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- [Terraform](https://www.terraform.io/downloads.html)
- [Google Cloud SDK](https://cloud.google.com/sdk/docs/install)
- Access to a Google Cloud project

### Terraform Setup

1. Authenticate with Google Cloud:
   ```sh
   gcloud auth application-default login
   ```
2. Update `terraform/backend.tf` with your GCS bucket name for remote state.
3. Set required variables in `terraform/envs/prod/` and `terraform/envs/dev/`.
4. Initialize and apply:
   ```sh
   terraform init
   terraform plan
   terraform apply
   ```

### Add cluster to kubeconfig
```sh
gcloud container clusters get-credentials konnektr-gke --region europe-west1 --project konnektr
```

### Bootstrap the Cluster

**Important:** Components must be installed in the correct order:

1. **External Secrets Operator** (to fetch secrets from Google Secret Manager)
2. **ArgoCD** (which depends on secrets managed by ESO)
3. **Platform apps** (managed by ArgoCD)

Run the bootstrap script:
```powershell
cd scripts
.\bootstrap-cluster.ps1
```

This script will:
- Install External Secrets Operator via Helm
- Create the ClusterSecretStore for Google Secret Manager
- Install ArgoCD (which will then adopt ESO and manage all platform apps)

### Kubernetes & GitOps

- Manifests are organized with `base` and `overlays` for each component.
- Use [Kustomize](https://kustomize.io/) for overlays.
- ArgoCD sync waves ensure proper installation order (see `.metadata.annotations` in manifests).
- Platform applications are automatically deployed via ArgoCD ApplicationSets.

## Best Practices

- Use modules for reusable Terraform components.
- Store state remotely in a dedicated GCS bucket.
- Use least privilege service accounts for Terraform.
- Parameterize namespaces in overlays to avoid collisions.
- Document all resources and variables.

## Next Steps

- Add platform and app manifests in `platform-apps/` and `apps/`.
- Expand overlays for dev environments as needed.
